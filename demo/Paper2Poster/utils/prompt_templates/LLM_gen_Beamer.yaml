  INSTRUCTIONS
  ================================================================
  1. Carefully read the Markdown in ``document_markdown``.
  2. Design a full-page academic conference poster in LaTeX Beamer:
     • Include a prominent header with title, authors, and affiliations.  
     • Break content into logical sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusions, etc.).  
     • Provide clear, informative text summaries.  
     • Embed relevant figures and tables, neatly arranged and aligned.  
     • Accurately represent key findings, methods, and conclusions.  
     • Ensure the layout is engaging, easy to follow, and visually attractive.  
     • Include all essential poster elements commonly found at scientific conferences.
  3. Write complete LaTeX Beamer code that, when compiled with pdflatex,
     produces the poster layout.
  4. The poster should use the Beamer document class with appropriate theme.
  5. Use proper LaTeX formatting for mathematical expressions, citations, and references.
  6. Include necessary packages for graphics, colors, and layout.
  7. **Output only** a JSON object with a single key ``LATEX``, whose value is
     the entire LaTeX Beamer code for the poster.
